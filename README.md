# WHO WANTS TO BE MILLIONAIRE?
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a console version of a multiple-choice quiz game that mimics the format, regulations, and thrill of the television series Kaun Banega Crorepati in which as you correct as many as question you get money ( which is not real of course) but you can treat this as points in this game
## FEATURES
Fundamental Game Mechanics (High-Level Features)
 The player experience and adherence to the KBC game format are defined by these features:

 Sequential Question Flow: The game ensures a consistent course through the levels by presenting questions in a set, preset order.

 Tiered Prize System: Each question has a unique list of prize money amounts (levels) that correspond to the game's escalating risks.

 Input Validation: To avoid problems from non-standard input, the code verifies that the user's selection is a valid option (A, B, C, or D).

 Correctness Check: To decide whether to continue, the user's response is immediately compared to the right answer key.
